## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project locally

### 1. Check `Node.js` and `npm` version
Ensure you have Node.js (required version 20.x) and npm installed on your machine.

(a). **Check Node.js version**: Open your terminal and run the following command to check your Node.js version:

```
nvm install 20
nvm use 20 --version
```
